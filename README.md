# Hand-Gesture-Prediction

Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN (Thumb, Palm, OK)
This project demonstrates a deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies hand gestures into three categories: Thumbs Up üëç, Palm ‚úã, and OK üëå gestures, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction.

Project Highlights:-
Multi-class classification: Thumb, Palm, OK gestures
